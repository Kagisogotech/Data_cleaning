## 📌 Overview

Cleaning data is often the **most time-consuming step** in data analysis.  
This project shows practical approaches to:
- Handle missing or inconsistent values
- Standardize column formats
- Remove duplicates
- Detect and treat outliers
- Export cleaned data back to Excel or CSV

The repository is designed as both a **learning resource** and a **reusable template** for future projects.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+  
- Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab  
- Libraries:  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `openpyxl`  

### Installation
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kagisogotech/Data_cleaning.git
   cd Data_cleaning
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

▶️ Running the Notebooks

  Launch Jupyter Notebook:
  jupyter notebook

🖥 Usage

- Place your raw dataset in the project folder
- Update the file path inside the notebook if needed
- Run all cells to generate a cleaned dataset
- The cleaned version will be exported as an Excel file (*_cleaned.xlsx)
